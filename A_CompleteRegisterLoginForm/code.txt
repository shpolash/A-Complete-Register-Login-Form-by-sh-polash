This is a complete register login form, I prepare this by using php,database, css, html. A simple form but so mouch useful and easy to code.

first you have to connect database to your php file you can get idea from config.php.

I created a database name project and my table name was project1.




connection process:

$connection = mysqli_connect('localhost','root','','myproject');


data retrieve process:
_____________________________

$query = mysqli_query($connection,"SELECT * from project1");
$row = mysqli_fetch_object($query);

echo $row-> first_name;
echo $row-> password;

alternate way to retrieve:

$row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($query);
echo $row['first_name'];

getting/showing data according to id:
________________________________

<?php

if(isset($_POST['registery'])) {
	$id = $_POST['idd'];

	$query = mysqli_query($connection,"SELECT * from project1 where id = '$id'");

	$row = mysqli_fetch_object($query);
 	echo $row->first_name;
 	echo $row->last_name;
 	echo $row->email_address;
 	echo $row->password;

 }
